The benefits of utilising STL algorithms as opposed to implementing the functionality by myself are as follows:
- faster development time since I don't need to create the algorithm myself from scratch
- doesn't require planning and debugging logical error
- The STL algorithms have been tested to be the most efficient piece of code. If I were to 
  make a similar algorithm for my program, it won't be as efficient


If I were to redisgn this program I would use error handling to prevent customer from passing in invalid string.
